The 3-Column Preview Card Component challenge focuses on building a responsive card layout that presents three distinct preview cards side by side. Each card contains an image, a title, and a brief description.

By applying CSS, I have implemented a layout that adjusts dynamically, allowing users to view the content comfortably on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
